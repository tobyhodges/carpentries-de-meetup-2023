## Lightning Talks
All attendees will be invited to present a two-minute lightning talk to introduce themselves and their local community to the rest of the group.
To keep the meetup on schedule, lightning talks will be kept strictly to the 120 second limit. If you would like to prepare visual aids to your lightning talk, please keep to a **maximum of two slides per person**.
Below are some points of guidance for what you might include in your lightning talk (but feel free to include anything else you think will be relevant to the other participants):

- Who you are, where you are based, what role(s) you have in The Carpentries community (e.g. Instructor, Maintainer, Workshop Host, etc)
- How your local Carpentries community interacts e.g. do you have local meetups, coordinate on a schedule for workshops, etc?
- What challenges do you/your community face with participating in The Carpentries?
- How are you hoping to benefit from joining this meetup?


## Skill-ups
The meetup will include at least two skill-ups run by attendees. The programme of skill-ups is still to be determined. **If you  would like to volunteer to deliver a skill-up to the other participants (maximum one hour), please [email the organisers](mailto:tobyhodges@carpentries.org)**.


## Community Discussion
The organisers will use the last part of the meetup to facilitate a general discussion,
to better understand the objectives and needs of The Carpentries community in Germany/DACH/Europe.
This will be an opportunity for us to gather ideas for themes/topics of future community meetups,
skill-ups that could be organised by and for community members,
and challenges that we can help the community to overcome.
It will also offer particiapnts the chance to ask questions,
and share more about the projects they are working on and relevant challenges they and their communities are facing.
